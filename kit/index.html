    <h1>PJC Kit</h1>

    <p>We have a range of technical shirts and vests in club colours (blue and white). We also have hi-viz yellow technical shirts for winter evenings. Other sundries such as bags, buffs, hats, and race-bib magnets are available too, to complete the PJC aesthetic.

    <p>Pop-up kit shops are held frequently at Lakeside prior to our club runs; these give you an opportunity to try things on and see what works for you. If we don't have your size in stock, let us know and we'll order it in.

    <p>Please note that to compete in the <abbr title="Hampshire Road Race League">HRRL</abbr> and <abbr title="Southern Cross Country League">SCCL</abbr> it is compulsory to wear a <em>blue &amp; white</em> club t-shirt or vest.

    <p>PJC Kit is managed by Chris Ellis. Please speak to your group leader if you need to be put in touch with him to purchase kit ourtside of club nights.
