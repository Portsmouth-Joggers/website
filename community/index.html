    <h1>In the Community</h1>

    <p>Over the past few years, Portsmouth Joggers Club has made numerous community contributions. Club members try
      their hardest to help those around them.</p>

    <p>
      <a href="/races/pl5/">Our Purbrook Ladies 5</a>, <a href="/races/sxc/">Summer Cross Country</a>, and <a
        href="/races/p2p/">Pub2Pub</a> all raise money for charitable causes. We decide which charities to donate to at
      our Annual General Meeting. In just the last three years, we have given more than Â£7,000.
    </p>

    <p> However, it goes beyond simply giving money.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Every February, we raise money and gather donations for neighbourhood food banks.</li>
      <li>Every August, we donate used running shoes and apparel to a South African running club.</li>
      <li>We have provided parking marshalls for the <a href="https://www.sustainability-centre.org/south-downs-green-fair.html" target="_blank">South Downs GreenFair</a>.</li>
      <li>Our members volunteer at two water stations for the <a href="https://www.greatrun.org/events/great-south-run/" target="_blank">Great South Run</a>.</li>
      <li>Our members have donated Christmas presents to a women's hostel.</li>
      <li>We donate extra and unwanted medals to <a href="https://runr.co.uk/pages/medals-for-kids/" target="_blank">Medals for Kids</a>.</li>
      <li>We have collected and donated children's clothing to KidsClothesLine Hampshire.</li>
      <li>We have provided water bottles to school playschemes that offer holiday activities and food for underprivileged children.</li>
      <li>Retired PJC members put on an annual Christmas Lights display to raise money for <a
          href="http://portchesterca.org.uk/woodsys-pantry/" target="_blank">Woodsy's Food Pantry</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We are also a running club for affiliated mental health. To help members who are having difficulties, we have
      welfare officers and a welfare fund.</p>
