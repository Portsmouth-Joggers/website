    <p>The Purbrook Ladies 5 is our ladies-only road race, organised by our Race Directors Rachel Thomas and Naouele McHugh. Starting out as a 6 mile race back in 1984, the race has inevitably changed over the years. It is now a 5 mile route that takes in the lovely lanes and countryside around Purbrook, and has a reputation for some fantastic post-race goodies (if we do say so ourselves!). The race is a firm favourite amongst the female running community and sells out very quickly every year.</p>

      <h2>2025 RD's Race Report</h2>

      <p>Wow wow, wow....what a morning.</p>

      <p>You ladies are absolutely awesome, inspiring and down right smashed that.</p>

      <p>We ordered, and she delivered the sun just in time for race day. Perfect conditions? I think so.</p>

      <p>You should be very proud. We are very proud and we honesty can't say it enough, you ladies are brilliant.</p>
      
      <p>Usual shout outs..Marshalls and volunteers!!!<Br>This year we saw a change in Head Marshall and it was Pete Birch who stepped up to the role. Thank you for everything you have done in getting this race delivered (it's been hard work this year) and sorting all the marshalls and volunteers.<Br>Everyone is so supportive and we wouldn't be able to achieve what we do without a massive team behind the scenes #teampjc </p>
      
      <p>Another big shout out to the fantastic Big G on lead bike. Every year without fail he is there, getting chased down by females.... no wonder he is first on our list.<Br>We also had an amazing sweeper in Emma, making sure everyone got to the end safely.</p>

      <p>This race is only as good as the support we get from each and every one of you, and you make sure this race is a success.</p>

      <p>Final shout out is to my daughter, Isabel and her 2 friends who were our photographers today.<Br>These girls are currently finishing their first year in college doing what they love, Photography.<Br>In the process of working out how to download the hundreds of pics from 3 cameras to FB.....but they will be coming soon. </p>

      <p>You guys make this special, and we THANK YOU and the privilege of allowing us to put on a fabulous race. </p>
      
      <p>Lastly, an apology on the "water problem" at the entrance to the pavilion. It was less then OK and we will be feeding this back to the council. Good job our excellent support crew in Gary saw this as an opportunity to bring your refreshments al fresco. </p>

      <p>For now, sit back and relax, knowing you have been bloody brilliant today. </p>

      <p>Much love<Br>See you in 2026</p>

      <p>Rachel, Naouele and Birch<Br>&#128153;&#128153;&#128153;&#128153;&#128153;</p>
