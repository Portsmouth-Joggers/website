        <h1>The Benefits of Club Running with Portsmouth Joggers</h1>

        <p>People take up running for many reasons, such as getting fitter, losing weight, or improving mental health; so what are the benefits of running with a club, and in particular, why run with Portsmouth Joggers?</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Run at your own pace</h2>

            <p>Our members run in <a href="/groups">groups of varing aims and speeds</a>, so wherever you are on your running journey we can accommodate you just as you are. From our <a href="/c25k/">Couch-to-5K</a> group for absolute beginners to our speedy <a href="/groups/#racers">Racers</a> group, we have something for <em>everyone</em>. </p>
            
            <p>The range of groups means that if you want to get faster there is always a group you can move into as you speed up; or, if you have an injury, need to take time out, or simply want a more steady-paced run, there are groups where you'll fit right in. Whatever your pace goals, there is a group for you!</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Be part of a community</h2>
            <p>Running is definitely not all about pace. Running with PJC makes you part of our community and our runs very much focus on the social aspect of running. Running with people and having a chat makes it more enjoyable and makes the distance and time fly by. There is always someone to talk to; to ask for advice, or offer support. Friendships are definitely formed at PJC and this is a real benefit of our friendly and inclusive club.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Feel safer when running</h2>
            <p>Running alone may not be appealing, particularly on darker evenings, and this may stop you getting out there at all. Running in a group can help you feel safer, so you're more likely to get out, to go for the run, and to enjoy it! You can be assured that the group leader will make sure that no one is left behind by bringing the group back together throughout the run when necessary. </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Be consistent</h2>
            <p>Having two scheduled runs each week helps you maintain consistency in your running routine. It can be challenging to stay motivated on your own, but by joining PJC, you can count on two regular runs every week without any extra planning. Just show up at Lakeside for 7pm, and you're ready to go.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Run with qualified group leaders</h2>
            <p>Our England Athletics qualified group leaders can bring variety to your running and help you to incorporate different types of sessions - like longer steady runs, intervals or hills.</p>
            <p>For each session they set the pace & type of run that the group does; they plan the route (which they share via social media beforehand so you know what to expect from the next session) and on the day they also lead warm-ups and cool-downs with stretching.</p>
            <p>Of course if you don't fancy what one group is doing, there are always other groups doing something else that you might enjoy!</p>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Enjoy the benefits of an England Athletics Affiliated Club</h2>

            <p>We are an EA affiliated club which brings with it many benefits. Firstly, this means that as a club we have insurance covering our group runs giving you that extra peace of mind when you head out each week.</p>

            <p>Being EA affiliated means you get the opportunity to be an <em>EA Affiliated Member</em>. This is not a requirement to join PJC, but it is worth considering as it brings discounts to race entry, training opportunities, wellbeing suport and kit discounts. To find out more see <a href="https://www.englandathletics.org/">the EA website</a>.</p>
            
            <p>In addition to the above, as a club, we receive a number of London Marathon places each year based on how many EA members we have. So if running the London Marathon is a dream, then by being an EA affiliated member (and if you are unsuccessful in the London Marathon ballot) you can be entered into the PJC ballot with much better odds at getting a place.</p>

            <p>EA Affiliated Members are also able to score points individually and for the PJC Team at events (more about these below), helping us in our friendly competition with other running clubs in the area.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Enjoy the variety</h2>
            <p>As a club we also mix things up a bit sometimes. On special occasions we hold whole-club runs. These happen on regular club nights and include the <em>Easter Bonnet Run</em>, the <em>Remembrance Run</em>, the <em>Mince Pie Run</em> and our <em>Mental Health Run</em>. Additionally, in the summer months some groups will do <em>"away runs"</em>, meeting further afield to enjoy the lighter evenings and a run out of the city, or nearer the seafront to make the most of our location.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Participate in events</h2>
            <p>We have plenty of opportunities to participate in local events and often organise car sharing to minimise costs and pollution.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://hrrl.co.uk/">Hampshire Road Race League (HRRL)</a> is a local series of road races that we enter as a club. They're a cost-effective way to get experience of racing, with no pressure to be fast - plus - they're super friendly events linking you to the broader running community.</p>

            <p>We also enter teams in the <a href="https://www.southerncrosscountryleague.co.uk/">Southern Cross Country League (SCCL)</a> which is a series of <em>free to enter</em> cross country runs held over the winter months. These are <em>great</em> fun (and often muddy!) and actually have a <em>maximum</em> speed for participation! Another great opportunity to get out and run but this time <em>in nature</em>.</p>

            <p>Many PJC runners also attend the local <a href="https://www.parkrun.org.uk/portsmouthlakeside/">parkruns</a> each Saturday, which links us to another community of people.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Join in or even help organise our events</h2>
            <p>We run our own events throughout the year, including the <a href="/races/sxc/">Summer Cross Country</a> at QE Country Park, the <a href="/races/pl5/">Purbrook Ladies 5</a> and the <a href="/races/p2p/">Pub-to-Pub</a> (every Christmas).  For all the events we organise and take part in, there is no expectation for people to be fast, they are focused on participation and enjoyment and setting your own goals.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Contribute to local and international charitable causes</h2>
            <p>We raise money for local charities through our events each year, and we're keen to spot new ways to support local groups, for example, in 2024 we:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Donated old race medals to a local charity who in turn distribute them to children at events, and
                </li>
                <li>
                    Participated in a nationwide running club food bank donation
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>We also have links to a running club in South Africa where we donate kit and trainers.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Spend less, do more!</h2>
            <p>We don't ask you to join up front. You can come along for a couple of weeks without paying to see how things work and try out a couple of group runs before joining.</p>
            <p>When you do decide to <a href="/join/">join us</a>, Portsmouth Joggers is extremely good value for money. Our yearly member subscription is far less what many health clubs and gyms charge for a single month, so we won't break your bank account!</p>
            <p>Of course, we can't guarantee you won't spend money on new trainers and maybe some extra running kit too, but as a member you'll get a discount at our local running shop!</p>
