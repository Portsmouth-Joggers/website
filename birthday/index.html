    <h1>Celebrating 50 Years of Running Together</h1>
    <p>As you may already know, 2026 is an extra special year for Portsmouth Joggers: it's our 50th birthday! 
    
    <p>Fifty years of running Pompey is quite the achievement, and we intend to celebrate in style. There will be monthly events throughout the year, including a birthday party in September, starting with the Burn’s Night Park Run on January 22nd. Details of other events are at the end of this page. </p>
    
    <p>We also want to make sure you are fully kitted up for the year ahead with a bespoke PJC 50th Birthday t-shirt! The technical t-shirts will be manufactured by Scimitar, in the same material as our regular club t-shirts. They look great as you can see from the pictures below.</p>
