    <p>On club nights we split into  <a href="/groups/">groups of different abilities and speeds</a>, so whatever your pace we will have a group to meet your needs. Unsure whether a running club is for you? Come along to a club night and see what you think! You are welcome to run with us for a couple of weeks for free, before we ask you to commit to becoming a member.</p>
    
    <p>We meet on Tuesday and Thursday evenings at 6:50pm in the atrium of <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@50.8410345,-1.0823719,3a,75y,231.82h,91.78t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sLSmv-zPgQbje3Z_ZDfg_HQ!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DLSmv-zPgQbje3Z_ZDfg_HQ%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D212.92085%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu">1000 Lakeside, North Harbour</a>.
