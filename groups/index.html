      <h1>Our Running Groups</h1>
      <p>Across the 10 PJC running groups we have a mix of speeds and distances. We try to cater for everyone regardless of where you are on your running journey. Runners are welcome to move between groups at any time, depending on your needs/goals, or just to try something different. In addition to the groups listed below we sometimes have specific running groups for events such as the Great South Run.

      <h2>Racers</h2>
      <p>Tony Conway and Kate Lewis have the pleasure of leading the Whacky Racers.

          <figcaption>Kate's been running for around 12 years &amp; joined PJC when she moved to Portsmouth in 2019. She liked the club so much that she became the club's Chair in 2024. Kate's an England Athletics (EA) qualified Leader in Running Fitness, &amp; also the club's Hampshire Road Race League Ladies' Team captain!

          <figcaption>Tony has been a member of PJC since 2002, having taken up running after leaving the Navy. He is an extremely experienced runner, having completed over 100 marathons!
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <p>The Racers are the speediest group at PJC, and our schedule is typically:

      <ul>
        <li>
          Tuesdays: Speed work, such as 800m reps, pyramids, or hill reps.
        </li>
        <li>
          Thursdays: A longer run, usually between 7-9 miles.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>The group pace is between 7:30-8:30 m/m (4:40-5:15 m/km), with some opportunities for going faster too, for those who wish to stretch their legs out. We regularly regroup, and faster runners will loop back so that we all stay together.

      <p>Starting in January, we typically target our training towards running a spring marathon, working to a structured plan to build endurance and stamina. You are, of course, welcome to join in whether you are signed up to a spring marathon or not! ðŸ˜€

      <p>Whatever we're doing, we always aim to have fun, so come give us a try!

      <h2>Pacers</h2>
      <p>Led by Pete Birch
      <figure>
        <img src="pete.jpg" alt="Pete" loading="lazy">
        <figcaption>Pete joined Portsmouth Joggers in early 2016 to train for the Great South Run, with the initial plan of running it, checking it off his list, and stopping. However, here he is, 8 years later, leading a group after completing 4 marathons, 1 Ultra, and various other Races.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>The PJC Pacers are positioned just behind the Whacky Racers in terms of speed within the club's training structure. We often train as one group, especially during our Tuesday speed work sessions.

      <ul>
        <li>Tuesdays: Speed work. We go through a series of speed work sessions designed to give your running that extra kick. Anyone can join in these sessions, as the pace is determined by your own race goals.</li>

        <li>Thursdays: We typically run 6 to 8 miles (10km to 13km) at a group pace of 8.30 to 9.00 minutes per mile (5.15 to 5.40 minutes per kilometre). The goal is to be able to maintain this pace without pushing yourself to your maximum effort. It's all about building up stamina.</li>

        <li>Weekends: Long slow runs (LSRs) usually with a mix of Pacers and Whacky Racers. These will range from 10 miles up to 20 miles during marathon training blocks. Pace for these will be slower than a Thursday session, aim for 2 to 3 minutes per mile slower than your 5k pace.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Pace Cadets</h2>
      <p>Led by Gina Reeve and Richard Sullivan

      <div class="sidebyside">
        <figure>
          <img src="nopic.jpg" alt="Gina" loading="lazy">
          <figcaption>

        </figure>
      </div>

      <p>The Pace Cadets training sessions are structured to cater to a variety of running needs and goals.

      <ul>
        <li>Tuesdays: Gina leads interval and speed sessions. These workouts are designed to improve pace and endurance, and all paces are welcome.</li>
        <li>Thursdays: Richard leads longer runs, typically ranging from 5 to 7 miles. These runs are paced between 9-10 minutes per mile (5:30 to 6:15 minutes per km), providing a steady and enjoyable run for all participants.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Special Training: In the summer, the Pace Cadets usually embark on a 14-week training plan for the Great South Run (GSR). Our goal is to help members complete the race in a target time of between 1 hour 20 minutes and 1 hour 40 minutes. We may train for other events during the year, depending on what group members are looking to achieve.

      <p>Group Dynamics: The Pace Cadets are positioned between the Pacers (faster group) and the Inbetweeners (slower group). This allows for a natural progression as members improve their pace. We often combine with the Inbetweeners on Tuesdays, as pace differences are less critical, and occasionally on Thursdays for longer runs.

      <p>Join us for a supportive and motivating running experience, whether you're looking to improve your speed, increase your distance, or train for a specific event. We look forward to running with you!

      <h2>Inbetweeners</h2>
      <p>Led by Steve Hyson

      <figure>
        <img src="steve.jpg" alt="Steve" loading="lazy">
        <figcaption>
          Steve started running when HE retired in 2018 and joined PJC in late 2019. He is an EA qualified Leader in Running Fitness &amp; started leading The Inbetweeners in January 2022.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>The inbetweeners is for those running at a pace of around 6:15 to 6:45 mins per km (10:00 to 10:50 mins per mile), i.e. you can do Parkrun's 5 km in around 32 / 33 mins, though anyone is welcome run with the group regardless of their pace as we all look out for each other whilst running.

      <ul>
        <li>Tuesdays: Interval training of some type which lasts an hour and normally covers 6.5-7km (4.5miles)</li>
        <li>Thursdays: A base run of 8-9Km (5 - 5.5miles). Occasionally the group joins up with other groups for a joint run, typically this is when we do an <q>away run</q> i.e. the groups choose somewhere else to run other than our home location of Lakeside.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Steve does a sixteen week training plan which he shares with the group and welcomes any suggestions or ideas of what to include in this plan.

      <p>The group also joins-in with the annual training plan in preparation for October's Great South Run.

      <p>PJC Next Step are the ideal group for those who have completed <a href="/c25k/">Couch to 5K</a> and want to continue their running journey, or for those who want to enjoy a chatty run at a pace of approx 7:30 mins per kilometre (12 mins per mile)

      <ul>
        <li>Tuesdays: Each alternate Tuesday we do interval training (designed to help you increase stamina and staying power) and the following week we do a 4 to 5 mile (6 to 8k) run (the same as Thurdays).</li>
        <li>Thursdays: we typically run 4 to 5 miles (6km to 8km). The group aim to run this continuously without stopping to walk.</li>

      <p>This Group is mainly aimed at slower runners who like to run and chat and for those that need to walk from time to time. We do loop backs, if needed, to keep the group together.
      
      <p>It's an ideal first step for those people who are not quite sure if they are confident enough to move on to the <a href="#nextstep">Next Step</a> after completing <a href="/c25k/">Couch to 5K</a>.

      <p>During the summer months we venture out to explore the beautiful countryside and seafront that we are fortunate enough to live near to.
      
      <p>If you fancy a run/walk or gentle plod with a group of like-minded people then why not come and join us.

      <p>For those who cannot make the 7 o'clock start, PJC Early Birds run from Lakeside at 6 o'clock.

      <p>We are very much a mixed paced bunch, who enjoy a social run with no emphasis on speed. There is lots of chat and plenty of laughter.
      
      <p>Typically we run 5-6k on Tuesdays and 6-8k on Thursdays, with the speedier peeps looping to keep us all together.
      
      <p>If you occasionally need an earlier run, come and join the early birds, you can be assured of a warm welcome.
