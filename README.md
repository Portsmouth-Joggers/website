Portsmouth Joggers Website
==========================

Guiding Principles
------------------

### Transparency
All updates, big or small, should be tracked openly in GitHub Issues. 
This makes the process visible to all members.

### Collaboration
We encourage members to submit ideas and bug reports as Issues.

### Organization
We use labels, milestones, and assignees to categorize and prioritize work.

### Incrementalism
We break down large projects into smaller, manageable Issues.


Process
-------

1. Capture *everything* as [Issues](https://github.com/Portsmouth-Joggers/website/issues/):
    * Ideas: New features, design changes, content additions.
    * Bugs: Broken links, typos, display errors.
    * Tasks: Regular maintenance (e.g., updating event calendars).

2. Label each issue
    * What type of issue is it? (e.g. bug, enhancement, content, design)
    * if there's no appropriate type add a new one.

3. Use Milestones for Major Updates:
    * Create Milestones for significant website versions or redesigns.
    * Associate relevant Issues with the appropriate Milestone.

4. Assign Issues:
    * Give or take responsibility for an issue to someone.
    * Use the Issue comments to discuss progress, ask questions, and provide updates.
    * Remember always that comments are public.

5. Resolve Issues with this workflow:
    * When startig work on an issue make a branch for it.
    * Resolve the issue in the branch.
    * Create a Pull Request & and submit it for review.
    * Others review the code and test the changes.
    * Make changes until reviewers are satisfied.
    * Reviewers merge changes into the main branch.
    * Site is automatically redeployed (within minutes).
    * Close the issue.
