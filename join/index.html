    <h1>PJC Membership</h1>

    <a href="https://forms.office.com/e/Y0BNJYgS06" id=joinhere class="actionButton" target="_blank">Join Here</a>

    <p>Runners are welcome to run with the club for two weeks without making any commitment to join - after that we ask you to complete a membership form and pay.</p>

    <p>Our membership year runs from April 1<sup>st</sup> to March 31<sup>st</sup> of the following year.</p>
    <p>Cost is £12 per year (reduced pro rata if you join after April).</p>


    <p>Click the big <strong>Join Here</strong> button to access the online membership form.</p>

    <!-- <p><mark>OBSOLETE SURELY:</mark> Please download the form, complete it and bring it to a club night or send it as an attachment to membership@pjc.org.uk</p> -->

    <h2>Optional England Athletics Affiliate Membership</h2>

    <p>If you are a keen runner and want to take part in affiliated England Athletics (EA) races, or join-in with the <a href="https://hrrl.co.uk/">Hampshire Road Race League (HRRL)</a> or <a href="https://www.southerncrosscountryleague.co.uk/">Southern Cross Country League (SCCL)</a> events then please consider signing-up for the optional EA membership too.</p>

    <p>This costs an additional £19 (not pro rated) and gets you £2 off many EA race entry fees, and allows you to run in the SCCL races for free, as well as other <a href="https://www.englandathletics.org/take-part/athlete-registration/benefits/">additional benefits</a>.</p>
