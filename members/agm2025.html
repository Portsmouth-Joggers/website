          <ol>
            <li id=item1>Nomination for Life Membership to be awarded to Tony Conway. Nominated by Davina Glading, seconded by
              Steve Wooldridge and endorsed by the Committee.
              <blockquote>
                Tony has been a PJC member since Nelson's parrot was an egg, he is a long time member with unbroken
                tenure. In this time, Tony has not only represented the club internationally, but nationally, and in leagues
                also. Tony has raced in ultra distance events, yet also been a real champion of C25K folks starting out – and
                everything in between.
                <p>Tony is the race organiser of the Pebbledash every year, which unites runners and walkers after the Christmas
                  excesses for a brutal leg stretch. The medals are, in themselves, a challenge for Tony to supply, this must take
                  some time.
                <p>Tony also motivated the Malta cohorts for several years with the training plans and accountability, all to
                  make sure that the PJC teams were well trained and ready to run the half, or full marathons. A wonderful
                  supporter (and runner) for Malta over the years.
                <p>Tony also is a wonderful support for the Ladies' 5 training runs, with whooping people around the course in
                  the months leading up to the actual race. He loops back and picks up the slower runners also with beautiful
                  enthusiasm and non-patronising encouragement.
                <p>There are also the all-club runs where Tony unites the entire PJC community, including the Remembrance
                  run. These are great fun, and all levels encompassing. Tony *never* says anyone is “slow or excludes anyone
                  – he is just the epitome of PJC ethos. Then, of course Tony is a Group Leader for the “mad-as-a-box-of-frogs
                  fast group.

            <li>
            <span style="color: red;">(apologies that this was missed from the published agenda)</span> Nomination for Life membership to be awarded
            to Bob Maguire. Nominated by Ally Smith and seconded by Sue Clarke. Bob has been a jogger for over 40
            years. He has run the marathon training at Mountbatten Centre for as long as I can remember. He is very
            encouraging to others to help them achieve the marathon distance. When running races he always waits and
            runs alongside us to make sure we are ok to finish, even though he could finish a lot earlier than us. All in all a
            true gentleman.</li>

            <li>Charity Request (£250) from Russ Tullett for Sophies Legacy, they do amazing work at the hospital to make
              parents and children's hospital stays a little more tolerable. It's a charity he ran WD200 for last December.
            </li>


            <li>Charity Request (£250) from Helen Sumbler for Purbrook Infant school PTA (registered charity) to sponsor a
              colour run we are planning. The donation would cover the cost of each child receiving a medal. And may get
              them running (would also put a special mention of Portsmouth Joggers on poster etc)</li>

            <li>Charity Request (£250) from John Shepherd for Creative Advances who are day support and outreach
              services, for adults with learning disabilities and autism.
              They run from Derby Rd, Portsmouth, Buckland United Reformed Church. They also have a small farm
              holding in Catherington Lane where some of their attendees go to clean out and look after the chickens, goat,
              lamas and ducks.
              My daughter goes to the farm one day a week and loves going there.
              A donation would help to keep the farm and workshops going.
            </li>

              <ol>
                <li>Paul and Pauline Jeffrey
                  <blockquote>
                    They can regularly be found representing PJC at races both locally and further afield. They are super
                    team players, always supporting others at HRRL races. They write regular posts on our Facebook page
                    encouraging other Joggers. In the past year they also took on getting the PJC Malta Marathon trip back up
                    and running, and are already planning next year!

                <li>Sue Clarke
                  <blockquote>
                    She is always in the mix of things helping the club, either on committee stuff, race directing, group
                    leading, and volunteering wherever she is needed. She does all of this not because she feels it's her duty,
                    she does it because it feels right to do it. And she likes to keep her wellness bucket nice and full.
                  </blockquote>
                  <blockquote>
                    She does so much for PJC that I'm not sure she gets the recognition for - she's an RD for the Summer XC,
                    a run leader, she helps organise the mince pie run, and she has taken on the roles of welfare officer and
                    vice-chair. On top of that she is always so welcoming and happy to help our members, new ones and old
                    ones.
                  </blockquote>
                </li>
                <li>Sue Hyson
                  <blockquote>
                    Sue works tirelessly behind the scenes, keeping PJC running. It is Sue who organises the committee and
                    communicates with EA to make sure we are always meeting the high standards required. Not only is she
                    the queen of organisation, she leads one of our groups and helps run the C25K programme. She
                    volunteers a significant proportion of her time to PJC, and that should definitely be recognised!
                  </blockquote>
                  <blockquote>
                    Sue does an incredible amount of work behind the scenes, keeping things running smoothly with her
                    dedication to the club's administration. She leads the Next Step group with energy and enthusiasm, and
                    without fail, takes on the Couch to 5K group every time a course is run. Sue is a fantastic ambassador for
                    Portsmouth Joggers and a truly valued member of the club.

                  <blockquote>
                    Richard has recently joined the website support team and has spent a considerable amount of time
                    working on the site and adding new pages to make it as attractive and professional as he can. He has also
                    set up a Strava group for PJC and uses this to advertise what each group is doing each club night. He's also
                    a group leader and encourages his group members to be the best they can
